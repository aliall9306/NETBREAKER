## Overview

NETBREAKER is a single-file, browser-based cybersecurity simulation game. Players work through a fictional darknet as a penetration tester, discovering targets, running recon, exploiting vulnerabilities, escalating privileges, and exfiltrating data — all using commands modelled on real-world tools and CompTIA Security+ / PenTest+ methodology.

No installation. No server. No dependencies beyond a modern browser. Open the HTML file and play.

---

## Features

### Terminal Emulator

A full in-browser terminal with command history (arrow keys), tab-autocomplete, a scrollable output buffer, and a persistent prompt that reflects your current session context (`handle@nb:~$` locally, `user@domain:/path$` on a target).

Every command has a manual page accessible via `man <command>`. Type `help` for a categorised command reference with the full attack chain at the top.

### Five Panes

| Pane | Function |
|------|----------|
| **TERM** | Primary terminal — all commands run here |
| **BROWSER** | In-game web browser with form interaction, vulnerability indicators, and browser tools |
| **FILES** | Interactive filesystem explorer for local virtual files and connected target filesystems |
| **NET** | SVG force-directed network map showing all targets, their status, and relationships |
| **CVE-DB** | Searchable vulnerability database that grows as you discover CVEs via nmap |

### Browser Pane Tools

- **INTERCEPT** — Burp Suite–style request capture. Pause any HTTP request, edit headers and body, then forward, drop, or send modified.
- **cURL Builder** — Construct custom HTTP requests with method, headers, and body. Detects SQLi, LFI, and auth bypass patterns in responses.
- **FUZZER** — Automatically tests all input fields on the current page for SQLi, XSS, LFI, and IDOR.
- **COOKIES** — Inspect and modify session cookies and role tokens.
- **DIFF** — Side-by-side baseline vs. modified response comparison to confirm exploit success.

### Network Map

Force-directed SVG graph rendered with a custom physics simulation (repulsion, spring forces, center pull). Nodes are sized by target difficulty and coloured by compromise status — undiscovered, discovered, shell, rooted. Hosts running miners display an amber ring. Hover for a tooltip; click to open the target modal with attack suggestions and contract status.

### CVE Database

Nine base entries covering the core fictional CVEs used in the game. Running `nmap -sV -sC` on targets dynamically discovers up to ten additional entries (including simulated versions of Baron Samedit, PwnKit, Dirty Pipe, Shellshock, BlueKeep, and others). Newly found CVEs are badged **NEW** in the database and immediately usable with `exploit`.

### Economy and Progression

Credits are earned through gameplay — not handed to the player at start. Every meaningful action pays out:

| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Scan discovers a host | +10c per host |
| nmap finds a CVE | +15c per vulnerability |
| gobuster run | +20c |
| Sniffer deployed | +30c |
| Web or SSH login | +40–50c |
| Exploit — shell | +75c |
| Root shell | +150c |
| Privilege escalation | +100c |
| Contracts | +200c to +30,000c |
| Mining (per 30s tick) | +8c to +80c per rig |

REP unlocks harder targets. Credits unlock tools. Mining provides compound passive income as you root more hosts.

### Mining System

Deploy an XMR miner on any rooted host with `deploy miner <ip>`. Income is credited every 30 seconds. Rates scale with target difficulty (easy=8c, med=18c, hard=35c, elite=80c per tick). Buying the Mining Pool from the shop doubles all rates. The topbar shows live income rate and the `miners` command lists all active rigs.

### OPSEC and Wanted System

A 0–5 star wanted level rises with noisy actions (exploiting IDS-protected targets, brute force, HTTP exfil). At three stars, an IDS alert bar appears. Tools and commands to manage heat:

- `clearlogs` — wipe local traces, −1 wanted (free)
- `clearlogs <ip>` — wipe remote logs, −2 wanted (requires Log Cleaner tool)
- `rotateip` — rotate attacker IP, break active traces, −2 wanted (requires IP Rotator)
- **VPN Chain** — passive, reduces wanted gain rate by 60%
- **TOR Router** — passive, prevents wanted gain entirely; required for elite targets

### Virtual File System

Local virtual files accessible via `cat` or the FILES pane at any time, no connection required:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `walkthrough.txt` | Quick-start guide and topic index |
| `walkthrough-targets.txt` | Full walkthroughs for all 7 targets |
| `walkthrough-web.txt` | SQLi, XSS, IDOR, LFI, CSRF technique guide |
| `walkthrough-opsec.txt` | Wanted system, log clearing, evasion |
| `walkthrough-mining.txt` | Mining setup, rates, economy progression |
| `exploits.txt` | Quick exploit reference |
| `tools.txt` | Installed tools and their commands |

### Script Editor

`editor` opens a script editor with four built-in templates (port scanner, privilege check, DNS exfil, reverse shell). Scripts are saved per-operative and executable with `run <name>`. Target filesystem scripts (e.g. `/opt/scripts/monitor.sh`) can also be executed with `run` when connected and in the correct directory.

### Procedural Company Schema

All seven targets are defined as plain JavaScript objects in the `COMPANY_DEFS` array. The game engine reads every field uniformly — nothing is hardcoded to a specific company. To add a custom target, append a new object following the schema documented in the source:

```js
// Fields: id, name, domain, ip, industry, desc,
//   diff (easy/med/hard/elite), repReq (int),
//   sec { fw, ids, mfa, waf } (bool),
//   scanReq { nmap, gobuster, sniffer } (bool),
//   ports [{ num, svc, ver, vuln, note }],
//   creds { user: pass },
//   rootMethod (str),
//   webVulns [str], webPages [str],
//   fs { path: [entries] }, fc { path: content },
//   contracts [{ id, title, desc, target, reward: { c, r } }]
```

### Save System

Three save slots backed by IndexedDB. Saves auto-persist every 15 seconds and on session close. Each slot shows handle, credit balance, REP, and last-saved date on the title screen.

## Patch Log

### v4.1 — Bug Fix
- Fixed `run <script>` not resolving target filesystem scripts; `run monitor.sh` now executes scripts found in the current working directory on a connected target
- Fixed `cat <script>.sh` showing `[Binary or unreadable file]` for target shell scripts; now displays content with a read-only notice
- `run` now accepts names with or without `.sh` extension

### v4.0 — Full Rebuild
- Complete file rewritten from scratch via Python string writes to eliminate all heredoc escaping and Cloudflare injection issues
- Procedural company schema: all 7 targets defined as plain JS objects in `COMPANY_DEFS`; custom companies can be appended following the documented schema
- Split walkthrough files: `walkthrough.txt` is now an index; topic files cover targets, web, opsec, and mining separately
- `help` command reorganised with attack chain summary at top and full categorised reference below
- `man` pages added for every command (25+ entries); tab-autocomplete covers all commands
- Dynamic CVE discovery: `nmap -sV -sC` adds up to 10 new entries to CVE-DB with **NEW** badge; `cve discovered` lists only found CVEs
- SVG force-directed network map replaces ASCII; custom physics simulation with repulsion, spring forces, and center pull; node colour/size reflects status and difficulty; mining ring indicator; hover tooltips; click opens target modal
- `run` command now checks target filesystem in addition to local editor scripts

### v3.0 — Feature Expansion
- Added 3 new targets: Darkpeak Analytics (med), OmniCloud Hosting (hard), Sentinel Defense Systems (elite) — total 7 targets
- Mining system: `deploy miner <ip>` on rooted hosts earns passive credits every 30s; rates scale with difficulty; Mining Pool doubles all rates; live income shown in topbar
- OPSEC commands: `clearlogs [ip]` wipes logs and reduces wanted; `rotateip` breaks active traces
- Credit rewards added to all major actions: scan, nmap, gobuster, sniffer, login, exploit, root, privesc
- Credits start at 0; early game balanced so first target is reachable through recon rewards alone
- Tool costs rebalanced: Metasploit 300c, gobuster 100c, sqlmap 200c
- `exit` and `q` added as aliases for `disconnect`

### v2.0 — Core Rewrite
- Rebuilt as single clean HTML file written via Python to avoid Cloudflare script-tag injection and email obfuscation
- All inline `onclick` handlers removed; events attached exclusively via `addEventListener` in `DOMContentLoaded` — eliminated phantom modal bug
- IndexedDB save system with 3 operative slots and auto-save every 15 seconds
- Wanted system (0–5 stars) with decay over time and IDS alert bar at 3 stars
- Browser pane with INTERCEPT, cURL builder, FUZZER, COOKIES, DIFF tools
- Web vulnerability simulation: SQLi login bypass, IDOR on `/api/users`, stored XSS in contact forms, LFI indicators, CSRF indicators
- Five panes: Terminal, Browser, Files, Network, CVE-DB
- Script editor with four built-in templates

### v1.0 — Initial Release
- Single-file browser game with in-terminal command interface
- Four fictional targets: PetroFlow, NexGenPharm, Arclight Financial, CivicGrid Power
- Core commands: scan, nmap, gobuster, deploy, exploit, privesc, persist, exfil, ssh, ftp, nc, contracts, shop
- CVE database with 9 base entries
- ASCII network map
- IndexedDB persistence
- CompTIA Security+ / PenTest+ methodology throughout

## Educational Context

NETBREAKER is designed as an interactive reference for the CompTIA Security+ and PenTest+ certification tracks. Every command, technique, and CVE in the game maps to a real concept:

- **Recon phase** — passive (sniffer) vs. active (nmap, gobuster) information gathering, OSINT
- **Exploitation** — CVE research, service fingerprinting, authenticated vs. unauthenticated attack paths
- **Web application testing** — OWASP Top 10 categories: SQLi, XSS, IDOR, LFI, CSRF, auth bypass
- **Post-exploitation** — privilege escalation vectors (sudo, SUID, cron, token impersonation), persistence, lateral movement, data exfiltration
- **OPSEC** — log clearing, IP rotation, covert channels (DNS exfil), detection evasion
